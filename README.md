  Hello world!

  Since 2005, when I wrote my first line of code in DarkBASIC, I've been hooked on programming!
  Throughout school and college, I jumped on projects to learn and grow as a developer. From there,
  I specialized in Go, becoming a proud Gopher at heart.
  I've worked on various projects, big and small, from monoliths to microservices.

  Excited about Go and emerging tech? Let's chat!
